Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.\nSpeaker 2: All right, I’ll tell her. Come on bugger face!\nSpeaker 4: Call me.\nSpeaker 2: You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window!",

You go!\nSpeaker 5: Chandler?\nSpeaker 3: No, that’s okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it’s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I’m sure?\nSpeaker 5: You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait!
